Soccer ball launcher made to be attached to wheelchair

When I was on Gunn High School Robotics, a child from a nearby middle school asked for us to make him an attachment for his wheelchair so that he could play soccer with his little brother. 
This project was almost entirely completed by Alex Fester and I, with a little help from some others on the team.
I spent over 200 hours on this project. 
In this repository, are testing videos of the almost finished project.
